# Overview

This is a program to acquaint myself with Kotlin. I initially wanted to jump into working with android studio, but I ran into issues trying to install it to the point that I had to repartition my harddrive and reinstall my OS. 

The purpose is to run through all of the following in Kotlin, noting any differences I find between Java and Kotlin:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

# Future Work

I would like to explore conditionals that use when. I would also like to play around with lambda functions more.
